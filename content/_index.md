# IPFS Docs Portal

Welcome! Here you will find documentation and guides you can use to get started working with the distributed web and IPFS.

## IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is the name of the project. You will need an IPFS app/library to work with IPFS. Right now there are two implementations available:

### go-ipfs

go-ipfs is the reference implementation of IPFS, and runs as an executable daemon on your computer. You can install it [here](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/).

### js-ipfs

js-ipfs is the JavaScript implementation of IPFS.


#### IPLD

IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) is the structure for storing data with IPFS. It allows you to develop complex data structures using JSON-like objects.
