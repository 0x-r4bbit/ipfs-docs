## Developing the site

### One-Time Setup

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
2. Install [AEgir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aegir)

    ```sh
    npm install -g aegir
    ```
    
3. Download IPFS libraries and tools (e.g. go-ipfs, js-ipfs) and generate their documentation:

    ```sh
    make packages
    ```
    
    (Repeat this step anytime a package with autogenerated documentation has a new release.)


### Build and Run the Site

* In the root directory, run `make serve`
* Load http://localhost:1313 in your web browser
* Edit and add things!
